Waste Sorting and Monitoring using IoT

Efficient waste management stands out as a significant contemporary environmental challenge. Properly managing the isolation, handling, transportation, and disposal of waste is crucial to minimize environmental risks. The most effective waste management occurs when waste is appropriately separated. The conventional manual method of waste separation requires significant human effort, time, and cost. Households and establishments often neglect the practice of segregating recyclable waste at its source, leading them to dispose of such waste on streets or in municipal bins without proper segregation. Approximately 15% of the total waste can easily be separated at its source for recycling. In this project, we propose a waste monitoring system that incorporates an integrated waste sorting mechanism, offering an uncomplicated and cost-effective means of segregating and monitoring household waste. The primary goal is to categorize domestic waste into dry and wet segments. Following the segregation process, the monitoring system communicates the quantity of waste generated by each household to the server. By implementing this system, we aim to not only streamline waste management processes but also encourage responsible waste disposal practices among individuals and communities. Additionally, the data collected through the monitoring system can provide valuable insights for policymakers and urban planners to optimize waste collection routes, allocate resources efficiently, and implement targeted educational campaigns to further enhance waste segregation efforts. Furthermore, the waste monitoring system can facilitate real-time tracking of waste generation patterns, enabling authorities to identify areas with high waste production and take proactive measures to address them. Existing systems do not have a proper monitoring system and use extra hardware modules such as GSM module to send messages. If there is proper monitoring, there is no automatic sorting of garbage in the system. Our project covers both the aspects and is cost efficient. Ultimately, the successful implementation of this waste monitoring system holds the potential to significantly reduce the environmental impact of waste disposal while promoting a cleaner and healthier environment for present and future generations.
